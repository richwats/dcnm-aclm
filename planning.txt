Datatables?

"host" type ACL entries

To Do:
- reorder function & interval
- PUT (update) function for all main edit functions

- Colour selected Devices rows
  - Green for currently applied
  - Red for pending remove?
  - Orange for pending add?

- Not displaying deployOuput (refreshFabric)

- update SELECTED_ACL on "new" hash...  part of async response to refreshFabric

ISSUES:
- Delete vs MarkDelete
  - Delete freeform automatically creates new -500 priority policy with source of old POLICY-ID
  - Every edit/update/delete creates new -500 deploy too
    - Not deployed/removed on "toDeploy" now...
    - Would work for detached
    - Not sure if can be directly deployed by ID?




DCNM Offloaded FrontEnd

- Need to define "Service" for backend
- Frontend will query DCNM for service location url
- Frontend needs special JS file for service lookup functions
- Frontend user Token
  - "username:admin:1"
  - "resttoken: xxx " ==> dcnm-token


- Need to update user logon/logoff
  - no longer relevant in DCNM AFW
  - check if "username" & "resttoken" cookie parameters present
    - if yes, start/continue session?
    - if no, return error
  - Need function to reset session
